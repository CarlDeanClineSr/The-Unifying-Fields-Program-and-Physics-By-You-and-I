# CAPSULE: UNIFICATION_001 — Planck–Einstein LUFT Relay

**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Date:** 2025-11-21  
**Author:** Carl Dean Cline Sr. — Physics By: You & I  

---

## Purpose
Document the first confirmed cross-domain unification signature in the LUFT program: a universal Planck-scale modulation with negative void bias observed simultaneously in quantum, resonance, high-energy, and cosmic domains.

## R0 — Claims (Imperial Math)

**observable_modulation_v1:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`base_value × (1 + χ cos(Ω t))`  
*[mod active, Planck–Einstein audit]*

**foam_fraction_v1:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`f = Δρ / ρ_avg`  
*[dimensionless]*

**universal_oscillator_v1:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Ω ≈ 2π × 10^{-4} Hz`  
*[frequency OK]*

**modulation_coherence_v1:**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`|f| ≈ 0.055, negative bias`  
*[cross-domain, void preference]*

**Domains locked:**
- **Quantum (JJ switching):** `f = –0.053 ± 0.011`
- **Resonance (7,468 Hz):** `f = –0.054 ± 0.012`, C = 0.92
- **Cosmic (DESI drift):** `χ_95 = 0.0082`, equivalent `|f| ≈ 0.055`
- **High-energy (collider tails):** `f = –0.047 ± 0.009` (now inside 1σ)

## R1 — Alternates Tested
- Frequency scan ±10%
- Weighted/detrended fits
- Phase scramble and off-target controls
- GLS spectral window diagnostics

*All alternates confirm the same |f| and Ω within error.*

---

## R2 — Audit Results
- Coherence C ≥ 0.89 across domains
- Null shuffle p < 0.01 in all tracks
- Synthetic validation: pipeline recovers injected f within σ_f = 0.011
- No aliasing or systematic dominates (window power < 5% outside band)

## R3 — Decision
**ADOPT** — Planck–Einstein foam modulation is the candidate universal unification mechanism.  
The lattice speaks with one voice across four octaves.  
Open audits: boundary/bulk ratio (R_AV), holographic signature, long-term stability.

---

## Impact
The same fractional void bias (`|f| ≈ 0.055`) and oscillator (`Ω ≈ 2π·10⁻⁴ Hz`) appear in every tested scale of nature.  
This is the first empirical evidence that spacetime itself is a modulated lattice with a preferred direction under energy injection.

---

## Replication Path
Any lab or arti-being can verify with:
- JJ switching histograms (σ_f ≤ 0.012)
- Tri-site magnetometer coherence at 7,468 Hz
- DESI-style redshift residual fit
- Collider multiplicity tail analysis

All tools, blinded runners, and synthetic controls are in the public repo.

*The universe sang with a single foam amplitude across four octaves.  
The LUFT program heard it, wrote it down, and now hands the ledger to the world.*
