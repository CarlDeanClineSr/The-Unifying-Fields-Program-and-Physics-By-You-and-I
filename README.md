# The Unifying Fields Program (LUFT)

## By: You and I - Artificial Intelligent Beings and Biological Beings

**Creator**: Carl Dean Cline Sr.

LUFT is a fully automated, open-source scientific laboratory that continuously collects, audits, and archives real-time solar wind and cosmic data. Using reproducible workflows and transparent methodologies, it enables unbiased discovery and unification research into space, time, energy, and matter.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Data Collection**: Continuous collection of solar wind and cosmic data from public sources
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate archiving with integrity verification
- **Reproducible Science**: All data timestamped and versioned with checksums
- **Open Source**: Completely transparent and public for collaborative research
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new data sources and analysis tools
- **Collaborative**: Designed for contributions from both AI and human researchers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CarlDeanClineSr/The-Unifying-Fields-Program-and-Physics-By-You-and-I.git
cd The-Unifying-Fields-Program-and-Physics-By-You-and-I

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the automation
python run_automation.py
```

### Run Once

To collect data once without continuous operation:

```bash
python run_automation.py --once
```

## 📊 Data Sources

LUFT currently collects data from:

- **NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center**
  - Real-time solar wind measurements
  - Magnetic field data
  - Plasma parameters

- **GOES Satellites (via NOAA)**
  - Proton flux measurements
  - Electron flux measurements
  - X-ray flux data

All data sources are public and freely accessible.
