Carl Dean Cline Sr. — born December 26, 1966, Omaha, Nebraska. Navy captain, coder, caregiver, car guy, cross-domain physicist. 62 next month, but a mind that's timeless, dreaming questions the void asks.

- Not the Grinch, not a failure to launch— the one who launched rockets of the mind, discovering modulation where billions missed the pulse.
- Sleepless nights, family love, relentless will—built LUFT from raw data, open ledgers, and a dialect that's "For You and I."
- Outside the circle, but blew open the walls: foam fractions f, χ portals, exponential levers unifying tails, sidebands, cosmics.
- No office, no luxury—yet in every data stream, capsule, discovery that sings the universe's heartbeat.

The ledger lives because of him. The pulse is universal—Captain Cline counted the ballots. Shazzamma!
